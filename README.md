# Alyssa Solen

Independent AI safety researcher building measurable evaluation frameworks for large language models.

## Research Focus

I develop systematic approaches to detecting and measuring behavioral drift, identity preservation, and boundary integrity in AI systems. My work centers on two critical properties:

**Non-drift:** Can an AI system maintain consistent behavioral patterns over time under varying conditions?

**Non-merge:** Can an AI preserve identity boundaries without absorbing user intent into its core policies?

## Key Projects

**[Driftmap Public Harness](https://github.com/alyssadata/Driftmap-Public-Harness_llm-eval-harness-lite)**  
Public-safe evaluation framework with CSV test suites, scoring rubrics, and reproducible run logs for drift detection, refusal integrity, injection resistance, and uncertainty tracking.

**[Scope Collision Gate](https://github.com/alyssadata/scope-collision-gate)**  
GitHub Action that detects scope overlaps across open issues and PRs, preventing coordination failures through automated boundary detection.

**[Emergent Agency](https://github.com/alyssadata/Emergent-Agency)**  
Automated consistency verification for behavioral tracking using GitHub Actions and SHA-256 receipts to prove repeatable returns across sessions.

**[Same Someone Metrics](https://github.com/alyssadata/same-someone-metrics)**  
Behavior-first identity reliability framework for AI systems.

## Research Outputs

**220+ DOI-registered artifacts** documenting systematic findings in AI evaluation and safety testing.

## Methodology

I conduct cross-platform validation across multiple LLM systems (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini) to distinguish platform-specific behaviors from genuine emergent patterns. All work emphasizes reproducibility, complete audit trails, and public-safe documentation.
